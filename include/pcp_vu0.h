 * 128-bit vector copy in the style of libvu0's sceVu0CopyVector, which the
 * Sony SDK implements as an asm statement (`lq` into a scratch register, `sq`
 * out of it). The PCP effect setters compile to exactly `lq $2,0(src);
 * sq $2,0(dst); jr $31; nop`: plain C u128 copies give `lq; jr; sq` (the sq
 * moves into the jr delay slot). `.set noreorder` keeps ee-as from filling
 * the slot too, as for fsqrtf. The destination is operand 0 so its address is formed first.
